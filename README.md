# HowManyTimes
This Safari extension allows you to know how many times you visited your favorite websites!

# How To install
You just need to unzip the HowManyTimes.safariextension.zip and add it to you safari's Extension builder and you're done!

#Actual issues
For now, the counting only works when a link is clicked. New stuff's coming soon!
